# Sires

Sires (*Si*mple *re*cord*s*) is a toy programming language and
a simplification of Hyloa, whose type system nevertheless has
all of Hyloa's essential features.

Sires is meant to provide a simplified formalism that can be used
to analyze Hyloa's type system. For this reason, features of Hyloa
such as procedure overloading, classes or most operators (which could
all be considered syntax sugar) are stripped, leaving just a bare
minimum.
